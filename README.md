# MidTerm-Project
Repository to upload the local git repo with all the simulation implementation

# About the repository
- You should add/modify the README.md file to include the names, code, email@unal.edu.co of each group member.
- It should include a suitable .gitignore ignoring, for instance, executables and backup files, among others.
- It should include only the minimum source files set necessary to reproduce the results. No binary, executable, backup, temporary, etc file should be synced to the remote repo.
- The git history should have several commits associated with the natural evoluction of the code.

# About the code
- It must compile (if in c++)
- It must execute correctly
- It must generate the correct output in a reproducible way.
- It must include instructions/code for post-processing (the plotting and fitting part)

# About the report (content)
- It is written as an scientific article (in spanish or english).
- It has to contain and introduction to the problem.
- It must report not only the results (both the initial power law distribution and the exploration for the nu or alpha parameter), but also the technical details of the implementation: programming language, data structures used, initial problemas and solutions, execution times (and machine, cpu, etc), initial conditions employed, TEST CASES used to validae results (like nu=0 and nu=1), some analysis and the corresponding instructions. 

# About the report (format)
- It must be written in Latex
- You can include it in this repo inside a sub-directory called "report"
- It must generate the pdf after compilation with pdflatex.
- Figures must be in pdf or svg with very good quality and easily readable labels.
